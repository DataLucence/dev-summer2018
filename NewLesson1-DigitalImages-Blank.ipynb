But here's what's really happening.\n",

    "Imagine that you send me on an errand to buy groceries. You give me detailed instructions (a program) describing the steps to take. So I get in the car and start driving to the store. Half way there, I notice I'm out of gas. That's OK, I have my own program for dealing with that. \"Buy gas at a station\" is a bit of instructions you didn't know I had, nor did you anticipate me using, but it's being used now anyway. I pull into the gas station, get out of my car, pay for the gas, and try to start filling up. However, the gas cover locks from the inside. I don't know about this (new car), and send you a text trying to precisely describe the error: \"Nozzle cannot pass through solid metal\".\n",

It's important to keep this in mind: the piece of code that reports an error is probably not the one that caused it!\n",

    "Stack traces report errors with the first call at the top. **This means that you should read a long stack trace by starting at the bottom and working up until you see a line of code that you wrote or a function you called.** This line is likely to be the line you have to change. Maybe you passed a string to a function when it needed an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines below code you wrote in the stack trace may contain hints about what's wrong. Maybe the lowest error at the bottom of the stack trace is \"Cannot subtract string from int\", which is a cluse that there was a string where an int should be.\n",

    "Higher lines tell you the context that the error happened in, i.e. what code ran before the error. Maybe you have a function that you use several times - you want to know _which_ usage of the function is giving you the error. If it's the 2nd time you use the function, then either the function _can_ work, but not in a particular context, or the function is being called in the 2nd location _before_ the first: the flow of your program is not what you expected."
