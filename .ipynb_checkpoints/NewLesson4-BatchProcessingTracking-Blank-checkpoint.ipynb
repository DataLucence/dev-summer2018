    "Congratulations, you've just completed an awesome image processing pipeline that takes an image and does something rather useful. You've tested it a few times and you're happy with the results. Now you need to apply the same operation to 1000 images. Maybe you need to apply them to 20 datasets with slightly different parameters. Maybe you need to aggreagate information across the results of each processed image to make your conclusions. Doing this can be hard, but sometimes it's so easy you can see many ways to approach this, and are not sure which one is the best. Let's talk about what you need to keep in mind when building systems to actually apply your pipeline."
